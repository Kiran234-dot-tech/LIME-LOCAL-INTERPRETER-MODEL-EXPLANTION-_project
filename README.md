# LIME – Simplified Explainable AI (Mini Project)

This repository contains a **college mini project** that demonstrates a **simplified version of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)**.

The project explains **how input features influence an AI model’s prediction** using feature perturbation and ranking.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
To simulate how **AI decisions can be explained** by:
- Changing one input feature at a time
- Observing how the prediction changes
- Ranking features based on their influence

---

## 🧠 Concept Used
- Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
- Simplified LIME approach
- Feature perturbation
- Local explanation of predictions
